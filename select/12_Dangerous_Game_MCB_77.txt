So you can find me
When you're goin' on and around me
I see stars in your eyes they are falling
And they're falling down for the love,
Love, love, for the love

You don't, don't know what you started now,
You can't keep me down, keep me down low,
You don't know how, I keep goin' on
Everyday, everyday,
I wanna run far away, I pray,

I'm on my way, today,
Can't stay, I'm going for sure,
Going for sure
Going for sure
So you can find me
When you're goin' on and around me
I see stars in your eyes they are falling
And they're falling down for the love,
Love, love, for the love
