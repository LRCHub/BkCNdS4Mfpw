It is so easy
The game you play
You left me wondering
What more can happen?

Lies and more lies
Till I'm bleeding
Is this really true?

Dangerous
The game you play
Stole my heart
The only one
It is dangerous
The game you play
Lost your soul to the moment
And gave everything away

Why don't you want to feel?
Why can't you be real?
Do what you want to do
I don't care no more

Lies and more lies
Till I'm bleeding
Is this really true?

Dangerous
The game you play
Stole my heart
The only one
It is dangerous
The game you play
Lost your soul to the moment
And gave everything away

Still I'm not alone
My heart is strong
Don't tell
I will carry on
Until the end

Dangerous
The game you play
Stole my heart
The only one
It is dangerous
The game you play
Lost your soul to the moment
And gave everything away
