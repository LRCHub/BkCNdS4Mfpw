Young boy
He's a brave young man
No illusions, no restraints
Hold tight, take control of yourself
Stand easy, your voice is too direct
Yeah

Young man
In a raging heart
Swish like water on hot coal
Set to kill, and if that's what you wanna do
Well, you better run if you wanna live before you die

What a dangerous game
When you're fooling yourself
What a dangerous game

Young heart
With a foolish desire
Seen the gangsters on TV
So that, if that's what you wanna be
Well, you better run if you wanna live before you die

What a dangerous game
When you're fooling yourself
What a dangerous game

What a dangerous game
Don't you know, don't you know you're fooling yourself?
Till your heart fills with shame
And never knowing what tomorrow might bring you
What a dangerous game
Don't you know, don't you know you're fooling yourself?
